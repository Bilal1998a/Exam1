        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>
          Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on
          down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. You can learn about
          Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in
          time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed
          to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to
          learn and explore. We also have the Young Stars club which meets once
          a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to
          explore and experiment with our team of experts. During the school
          holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other
          children your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we
          pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club
          and how you can join, send us a message.
